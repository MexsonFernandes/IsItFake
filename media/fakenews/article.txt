2) First, the border conflict could simply be a means of relieving leaders of both countries from rising internal pressure. The worsening global economic conditions and the ongoing China-US trade war no longer enable Beijing to rely on rapid growth as the sole source of the regime’s security. Instead of relying on its domestic economic performance, China is showcasing its strength by defending its territorial claims.

Therefore, Beijing has been more aggressive not only in the China–India border conflict but also elsewhere. In recent weeks, China has deployed more troops to the South China Sea and more jets to the Taiwan Strait. It has also passed a national security law to tighten its grip on Hong Kong.
Second, Beijing might be calculating that India is too occupied with fighting the COVID-19 disease to wage a border conflict with China.
Third, China might just be showing off its army’s capabilities while, at the same time, delivering a political message to India not to get too close to the US. Since the 2017 Doklam border standoff, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been moving closer to the Americans. India has agreed to expand its two-way trade in advanced defense items and become part of the US manufacturing supply chain. The South Asian giant has also decided to block Chinese companies from taking over domestic businesses. If India moves closer to the US, this could hamper China’s infrastructure development in South Asia, including the disputed economic corridor that links China to Pakistan.
Fourth, the border conflict might be serving Modi’s domestic political needs in addition to Chinese President Xi Jinping’s, but a full-blown would serve neither. The novel coronavirus, which causes the COVID-19 disease, has hit India hard and the government has been criticized for its response. At the time of publishing, there were over 340,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in India.
Before the outbreak of the coronavirus, many ethnic groups and the opposition organized nationwide protests against the country’s new citizenship law, which allows persecuted non-Muslim minorities to become Indian nationals. Furthermore, since India revoked Kashmir’s semi-autonomous status in August 2019, the disputed territory has been under lockdown. The border issue diverts citizens’ attention conveniently. Also, India considers this a strategic opportunity to push China to recognize the current status of the border, given that it is under immense international pressure. India sees China in no condition to start a war.
Fifth, both sides may be jostling to gain favorable strategic positions on the border, but they know that the costs of starting a war outweigh its potential benefits for both of them. These two nuclear powers have enough deterrence capacities against each other. Besides, a conflict with India would weaken China’s focus on meeting key security challenges in the South China Sea. At the same time, India recognizes its military inferiority and inability to win an outright war. In 2019, China’s national defense budget was $261 billion, almost three times that of India’s $71.1 billion.

3) Maneka Gandhi’s Claim That 600 Elephants Are Killed Yearly in Kerala Defies Data In an interview with ANI, BJP leader and animal activist Maneka Gandhi claimed that ‘over 600 elephants are killed in Kerala every year.’
Let us analyse the official numbers.
In February 2019, Dr Mahesh Sharma, Minister of State in the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change said that data from 2015 - 2018 shows that there have been a total of 373 elephant deaths across India, of which 226 of these deaths have occurred due to electrocution, 62 due to train accidents, 59 due to poaching and 26 due to poisoning.
The figures presented by Babul Supriyo, MoS (MoEF) in February 2020, stated that there had been 269 elephant deaths during this same period. Though both their figures are slightly variying, it is clear that even the official All India figures are less than Maneka's claims about Kerala.



Sample Real News:

1) “The suspects hid the explosive inside a coconut and placed it in the forest as a snare to kill wild pigs. All three of them have played a role in it. We have arrested Wilson and we will catch the other two persons soon,” said the officer.
As part of corroborating evidence, Wilson, post-interrogation, took the police and forest officials to a shed on the plantation where they reportedly prepared the explosives. Some remnants of the explosives were found at the shed.
According to the police, the pregnant elephant chomped on the coconut accidentally on May 12 which resulted in deep injuries inside its mouth. The suspects reportedly knew that the elephant was injured in the explosion the same day. For the next two weeks, the elephant wandered through the area, slipping in and out of the forest, as it endured the pain, unable to eat or drink water. On the morning of May 25, the elephant, thoroughly exhausted and writhing in pain, reached the banks of the Velliyar river. A forest task force team, which spotted the elephant, realised that she was injured. Using two kumki elephants, it tried to rescue her, but she would often charge at them. Finally, on the evening of May 27, the elephant collapsed in the river and died.
M Ummer, a former ward member of the Kottopadam panchayat, said the locals and farmers in the region are frequently troubled by wild animals who raid their crops. Since the area is located close to the buffer zone of the SVNP, the movement of wild elephants is inevitable.
“We often contact the DFO and stage protests when our crops are destroyed. But we have never tried to injure the animals using such snare traps. It’s not a practice that we believe in. And that’s why I don’t think our locals are involved in this,” he said.

2) KOCHI: As the brutal killing of a pregnant wild elephant in Kerala led to widespread condemnation, a similar incident has came to light in Kollam district, where a young female elephant died of injuries in her mouth, a month ago.

The pregnant wild elephant in Silent Valley Forest had fallen victim to an act of human cruelty on May 27 after a pineapple filled with powerful crackers offered by a man exploded in her mouth when she chomped on it.
A top forest officer told PTI that another female elephant had met with similar fate in April in Pathanapuram forest range area under Punalur division in Kollam district.
The officer said the elephant was found in a serious condition from the fringe areas of the forests in Pathanapuram by forest officials in the month of April.
"The pachyderm was found alienated from the herd of elephants. Its jaw was broken and it was unable to eat," the senior officer told PTI.
"It was very weak. When the forest officials approached, the elephant ran into the forest and joined the herd of elephants waiting there. But the next day, the elephant was again found alienated from its herd. Proper treatment was given but unfortunately it succumbed to its wounds," he said.
